# STAS380 Exercises
This repository contains the final report + solutions for the STA S380, Part 2 exercises. The project includes a series of data analysis tasks using Python-based Jupyter notebook, focusing on various statistical and machine learning techniques. The tasks cover a wide range of topics including:

- **Probability**: Calculation of probabilities using the rule of total probability.
- **Data Wrangling**: Analysis of Billboard Top 100 data to explore trends in musical diversity and popularity.
- **Data Visualization**:  Use data visualization to support decisions on whether to invest in eco-friendly buildings as well as to analyze Austin's Capital Metro bus network.
- **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**: Application of PCA, t-SNE, and k-means clustering on wine data to distinguish between red and white wines and assess quality.
- **Market Segmentation**: Identification of market segments in Twitter data using clustering techniques.
- **Storytelling Analysis**: Revisited the Reuters C50 text corpus briefly explored in class to tell an interesting story anchored with some analytical tools.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Discovery of interesting association rules in grocery shopping data.
- **Image Classification with Neural Networks**: Training of a neural network to classify satellite images using PyTorch.

Each problem is solved using appropriate methods, such as logistic regression, k-means clustering, PCA, t-SNE, and neural networks, with results presented through visual and numerical storytelling.
